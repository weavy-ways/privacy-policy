    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-11-16</p>

    <p>Welcome to Weavy Ways. This Privacy Policy explains that we do not collect, store, use, or share your personal information. All game data is kept locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>None. We do not collect personal data, device identifiers, analytics, or account information.</p>

    <h2>2. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>Your game progress and settings are stored locally on your device and never leave it.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>None. We do not sell, share, or transmit your data to third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Because no data is stored on our servers, uninstalling the app removes all local data from your device.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You can continue playing without creating an account. You may delete local data by uninstalling the app or clearing the app's data in your device settings.</p>

    <h2>6. Children</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since we collect no data, the game contains no user tracking.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy occasionally. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, please contact us via email eugenete1987@gmail.com</p>
